# yeoman-gulp-webapp
This is a template generated from generator-gulp-webapp, with modifications:
- JADE support
- `gulp` for local development
- `gulp build` for builds
- While developing locally:
	- Supports namespaced folders instead of filetype specific folders
	- Compiles css files to same directory as scss files (instead of .tmp)
